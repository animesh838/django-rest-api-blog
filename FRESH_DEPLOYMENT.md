# Fresh Railway Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your cleaned Django app to Railway from scratch.

## 🚀 **Step 1: Delete Old Railway Project**

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Find your old project
3. Click the three dots menu
4. Select "Delete Project"
5. Confirm deletion

## 🚀 **Step 2: Create New Railway Project**

1. **Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Click "Start a New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Connect your GitHub account** (if not already connected)
5. **Select your repository**: `animesh838/django-rest-api-blog`
6. **Railway will automatically detect Django** and configure deployment

## 🔧 **Step 3: Add Environment Variables**

Once Railway starts deploying, add these environment variables:

1. **Go to your new project** in Railway dashboard
2. **Click "Variables"** tab
3. **Add these variables**:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-your-unique-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-new-domain.railway.app
```

**Replace `your-new-domain.railway.app` with your actual Railway domain.**

## 🗄️ **Step 4: Run Database Migrations**

After deployment, you need to run migrations:

1. **Go to Railway dashboard**
2. **Click on your web service**
3. **Look for "Deployments" or "Terminal"**
4. **Run this command**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## 🌐 **Step 5: Test Your App**

After everything is set up, test:

1. **Main site**: `https://your-new-domain.railway.app/`
2. **Posts page**: `https://your-new-domain.railway.app/posts/`
3. **API test**: `https://your-new-domain.railway.app/api/test/`
4. **API posts**: `https://your-new-domain.railway.app/api/posts/`

## 📋 **What's Different This Time**

- ✅ **Clean code**: No Railway-specific configurations
- ✅ **Simple database**: Using SQLite (easier to set up)

3. **Database migrations**: 1 minute
4. **Testing**: 5 minutes

## 🚨 **If You Get Errors**

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
